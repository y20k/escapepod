### Submit your own solutions
Help is very welcome. Be it in the form of code, or artwork, or enhancements to the website, or tutorial videos, or whatever.
**But please** suggest new features or enhancements in advance in the [Issue Tracker](https://codeberg.org/y20k/escapepod/issues) before implementing them. The issue [‚ö†Ô∏èüöß Previous discussions and feature requests #readmefirst](https://codeberg.org/y20k/escapepod/issues/24) is probably a good starting point, if you want to know what kind of features are desired / controversial.
